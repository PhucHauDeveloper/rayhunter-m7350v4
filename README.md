### ðŸš€ What's New in This Fork

This customized fork brings major usability and feature upgrades over the original Rayhunter release:

âœ… OPKG Package Manager Included: 
Enjoy the flexibility to install whatever you need with 2.8MB of free space remaining. Explore available packages at [Entware Repository](http://bin.entware.net/armv7sf-k3.2/).

âœ… Time Sync & Display Enhancements: 
The device now syncs time with your computer and displays it on the screenâ€”alongside band, TTL, RSSI, RSRQ, and SNRâ€”making the device more useful at a glance.

âœ… Live Rayhunter Status Indicator: 
A #: symbol before the band indicates that Rayhunter is active. If it's missing, Rayhunter is inactive.

~~âœ… Physical Button Toggle for Rayhunter:~~
~~Hold the top button for 2 seconds (while the screen is active) to enable or disable Rayhunterâ€”perfect for reset the red line.~~
(is coming to main branch and mine is no longer a diff)

âœ… Improved Security Defaults: 
SSH is enabled by default after installation, while Telnet is automatically disabled.

âœ… Built-in TTL Modification Tool (ttlset): 
Easily change TTL values to help bypass carrier tethering restrictions.

âœ… Integrated OpenVPN & cURL Support: 
VPN functionality and web tools are ready to go, plus the latest IPS updates are included for better network protection.

ðŸ“Œ These enhancements are designed to improve user experience and security while keeping installation simple and accessible.
